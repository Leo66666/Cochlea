# Cochlea
## Project description
A cochlea model is created to simulate the forces exerted on 'Hensenâ€™s Stripe' and 'Hair Bundle'. This project is aiming to compare the theoretical results and the numerical results.
## Data source statement
The data used in the code is from a comsol simulation.

## Problems

We find that using dpdx can lead to fatal erro between the results, we should change to use flow rate to calculate.
